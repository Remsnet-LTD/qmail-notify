Development versions of qmail-notify are available via anonymous CVS.
Set your CVSROOT to ":pserver:cvs@bruce-guenter.dyndns.org:/CVS",
login with an empty password, and check out the "qmail-notify" module.

Requirements:

- qmail 1.01-1.03, with or without the big-todo patch

- cron

Installation:

- As root, run:
	make
	./installer

Configuration:

- The simple usage is to put qmail-notify into an hourly cron job.  For
  more details on the options, run "qmail-notify -h".

- To use an alternate response message, save the message to a file and
  specify the path to the file with the "-f" option.  The file must
  contain three instances of "%s".  The first is replaced with the
  server's hostname; the second is replaced with the notification delay
  (controlled by the "-t" option); the third is replaced with the
  message lifetime (controled by the qmail control/queuelifetime file).
