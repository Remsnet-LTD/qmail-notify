Requirements:

- qmail 1.01-1.03, with or without the big-todo patch

- cron

Installation:

- Make sure the latest version of bglibs from
  http://untroubled.org/bglibs/ is compiled and installed.
- Build the sources by running "make"
- After the package has been compiled, run "make install" as root.

Configuration:

- The simple usage is to put qmail-notify into an hourly cron job.  For
  more details on the options, run "qmail-notify -h".

- To use an alternate response message, save the message to a file and
  specify the path to the file with the "-f" option.  The file must
  contain three instances of "%s".  The first is replaced with the
  server's hostname; the second is replaced with the notification delay
  (controlled by the "-t" option); the third is replaced with the
  message lifetime (controled by the qmail control/queuelifetime file).
